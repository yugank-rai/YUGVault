# 🧠 YUGVault

### Hi there! 👋 I'm Yugank Rai

I'm a passionate **Computer Science Engineering student** at **IIIT Bhagalpur** and a dedicated learner.

While my other repositories track my coding journey, **AlgoVault** is the tool I built to organize it. This is a fully functional **Personal Problem Tracker** designed to help Competitive Programmers and DSA students save, tag, and review their solved problems efficiently.

**🌱 My Goal:** To build a practical utility tool that solves a real problem I face as a student—managing the chaos of LeetCode and Codeforces links—while mastering **DOM manipulation** and **Browser Storage**.

### 🚀 About The Project

**AlgoVault** is a sleek, dark-themed web application that acts as a personal database for your coding problems. Instead of using messy spreadsheets, it allows you to save problem links, attach key "tricks" or notes, and filter through your collection instantly.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Live Search:** Instantly filter your collection by Problem Name or Tag (e.g., "DP", "Arrays") without reloading.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses **LocalStorage** so your data is saved automatically and stays there even if you refresh or close the browser.
* **Smart Tagging:** Categorize problems with tags like Arrays, DP, Trees, and Graphs.
* **Trick Tracker:** A dedicated section to save the specific "Aha!" moment or trick for every problem.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile, featuring a modern Glassmorphism UI.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Learnings

This project was built to solidify my understanding of the following concepts:

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Mastering `filter()`, `map()`, and Event Listeners for the search logic.
* **LocalStorage API:** Learning how to persist state in the browser (Create, Read, Delete) without a backend database.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and injecting HTML cards based on user input.
* **CSS3:** Implementing modern design trends like Glassmorphism and using Flexbox/Grid for layout.
